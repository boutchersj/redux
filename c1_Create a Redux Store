const reducer = (state = 5) => {
  return state;
}

// Redux methods are available from a Redux object
// For example: Redux.createStore()
// Define the store here:
let store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

//Here we create a Redux store variable that manages application state
//All state management must be done through the Redux store
//'.createStore()' requires a reducer function as an argument
//All a reducer function does is take state as an argument and return state
